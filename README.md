## 2021 - First Homework
Image Classification
Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course! You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course. We set up a competition to make things more fun! ðŸ˜Ž

In this homework you are required to classify images of leafs (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

Please find the dataset details at Participate/Get Data page and a description of the evaluation procedure at the Learn the Details/Evaluation page. We recommend to read the instructions carefully in all the pages and to check the Learn the Details/Rules page before starting submitting.

## Recommendations
Use the framework we have seen during the practical lessons to solve the homework (Tensorflow, Keras).

Note: if you want to use your GPU for the experiments, you have to install the right GPU drivers for your device and CUDA version. We recommend the following guides:

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu

Additionally, as shown during the course, you can use Google Colaboratory to have free GPU on cloud. Please notice that the time you can use the GPU is limited. Read the Colab instructions for further details.

You can find an additional free GPU also on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), with limitations. Please have a look to https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage.
